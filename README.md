### Hi I'm John ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**jml-6/jml-6** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am working to harmonize business storytelling and data analytics.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on graduating with a BS in Statistics from Brigham Young University in April 2023
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently practicing SQL, Excel, Python, R, and Tableau
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a professional magician, I can do 6/7 of the basic jumps in ice skating, and I am going to read 100 books in 2022
