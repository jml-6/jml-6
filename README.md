### Hi I'm John ðŸ‘‹

I am working to harmonize business storytelling and data analytics. A few things about me:

- ðŸ”­ I will graduate with a BS in Statistics from Brigham Young University in April 2023
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently practicing SQL, Excel, Python, R, and Tableau
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a professional magician, I can do 6/7 of the basic jumps in ice skating, and I read 100 books in 2022
